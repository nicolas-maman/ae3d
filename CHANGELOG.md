# Changelog

## [current]

First working engine.

### Rendering

- `Backend`, a vtable both renderers fill in, so a program picks its renderer
  with a constructor argument and nothing else changes.
- OpenGL 4.1 core backend: PBR materials, directional and point lights,
  instanced rendering, frustum culling, a separate transparent pass, MSAA, FXAA
  and bloom. Uniform locations resolve once per program into named slots.
- Vulkan backend, windowed, on a loader opened at runtime with native surface
  creation on macOS, Windows and X11. Nothing links against Vulkan, so a program
  built with it still starts where no driver exists.
- All thirteen GLSL programs ported, including the PBR and Gerstner-wave
  fragment shaders.

### Content

- OBJ and MTL loading with vertex deduplication and per-material index ranges.
- Procedural cube, sphere, plane, quad and water-grid primitives.
- Gerstner-wave ocean with the wave table in the model's uniform arrays.
- Voxel worlds drawn as one instanced call, with exposed-face culling.
- Surface nets over a signed distance field: one vertex per cell that straddles
  the surface, placed at the average of its edge crossings, with quads around
  every sign-changing grid edge and normals from the field gradient.
- Improved Perlin noise with a platform-independent seeded shuffle.
- Game objects and components, ray casting, and a fly camera with frustum
  extraction.

### Scenes

- Scene save and load. A model from a file records its path and reloads through
  the OBJ loader; a procedural one writes its geometry to a gzip-compressed
  binary mesh, float32 stored as its IEEE-754 bit pattern in little-endian order
  so a file written on one host reads back identically on another.

### Shading presets

- Default, high quality, performance and voxel configurations over the advanced
  features the fragment shader exposes: clearcoat, sheen, transmission, image
  based lighting, procedural noise, soft shadows, volumetric lighting, screen
  space occlusion, global illumination, bloom and filtering quality. Applying a
  config writes a model's own uniforms, so two models in one scene can run
  different settings through the same program.

### Engine

- Window, input and timing over GLFW.
- Main loop with a fixed-step accumulator, frame pacing and `AETHER3D_FRAMES`,
  which caps any program at a frame count so every example is also a smoke test.

### Measured

Per-frame costs, measured headless so they are the engine's own rather than the
GL implementation's, over two thousand iterations with zero leaked bytes and
26MB peak:

- 578us to upload 200000 instance matrices, 12.8MB a frame.
- Under a microsecond each for a model transform, a camera and frustum rebuild,
  and a water uniform update.
- 19ns per Perlin sample; a 131072-cell exposed-face scan under a millisecond.


- 256x256 ocean: 65536 vertices and 390150 indices built in 2ms.
- 192x192x48 voxel terrain: 960464 solid voxels reduced to 93030 visible,
  generated in 9ms, instanced in 7ms, one draw call.
- 200000 particles under Verlet integration in two instanced draws at 126fps.
- 250000 sand grains falling, colliding and settling in one instanced draw at
  70fps.
- 160x160x64 field meshed by surface nets into 34241 vertices and 67590
  triangles in 33ms, one draw call at 106fps.
